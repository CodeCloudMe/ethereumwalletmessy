This is a fork of a the CoPay bitcoin wallet and is stripped down to be a simple Ethereum wallet.
This is for experimentation only.
Most of the JS logic is messily put in index.js at bottom. 
The core Ethereum lib is in etherwallet-master.js.
The front-end is all in walletHome.js
Cleaning up and adding logic soon.
